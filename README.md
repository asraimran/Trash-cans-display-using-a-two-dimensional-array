# Trash cans using a two dimensional array in python
The purpose of this question is to write a complete Python program that represents some trash cans using a two dimensional array. Each column of the array represents a trash can. Each row of the array represents bags of trash in the cans. Each trash can holds the same number of bags of trash. When one can is filled with bags of trash a message is displayed and the program terminates.
